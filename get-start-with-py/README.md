# Syntax and spacing 
print is used to print to the console
syntax eeror happen when you have the wrong syntax (broken programming gramma)

# variable declaration
x = 2 + 3;
can be printend through using print(x);
the output of this will be 3

# spacing 
to effectively space your code use \
example:
x = 2 +     1 \   
3;
this will return the total of 2 and 1 and 3

# commenting 
single line comments are done using 1 #
multi line comments are done using """ """
comments should explain in brief the code
 
 # variable types
 allow you to work and manipilate data 
 their values can be changed and manipulated
  # declaration
   x = 10;
# to change the value of a variable 
    X = 20;

# variable naming
give variables explanatory names
variable give referance to a value
you cane name using camel cases 
be consistant in your naming 
varriable reasignement does not overwrite its content

# DATA TIYPES
A data type is an atribute of a variable that defines the type of data that can be stored in the variable and tell the intepreter how to interpret its value
# NUMERIC 
has (integers, float, complex number)
### INTEGER 
any non fractional number 
can be  + or -
example 10 or -10
### FLOATS
 has decimal numbers 
 explamples 
 10,45 
 10,000000009
 
 ### COMPLEX 
 complex numbers made up of real and imaginary number 
 example 
 10 + 10j

# SEQUENCES
has (string, list, tuples)
### STRING
is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes
represented with str
example
### to declare 
 my_string = "hello world"
  ### for multi lines 
  my_string = "hello world \
  this is a multi line string\
  this is the end of the string"
 
  ## TO REASINE 
  name = "john"
  name = "jane"

  ### USES INDEXIG 
  to check length use len
### LIST
is a sequence of values
are array 
can be accessed by indexes
represpented by list() 
values are in []
### TUPLE
is a sequence of values
they are not modifiable or changed
can be accessed by indexes
represented by tuple()
values are in ()
# DICTIONARY
key value objexts 
stored in {}
store any data type
represented by dict()
to print value access the key
can be done in indexing
# SET
unorderd and non indexed set of values
represented by set()
# BOOLEAN
has only 2 values (true, false)
represented by bool()

# BUILT IN FUNCTIONS

# 1 type(value)
tells you the data type of a value 
# 2 len(value)
tells you the length of a value
